          Annotation Tool - Reachability Experiment
        </Typography>

        {/* ////// Task Intro */}
        <Typography variant="subtitle1" align="left">
          <h3>Instructions</h3>
                In this experiment, you will be asked to annotate parts of reachable environments, to indicate how someone might interact with them.
                < br/>
                
                <ul>
                <li>First, please indicate ALL objects or elements that someone could interact with their hands. Imagine the picture is someone's viewpoint - what are all the components that they could act on from that position?
                </li>
                <li>
                Next, indicate only the subset of objects or elements that are most likely to be interacted with. Ask yourself: in a standard interaction, what subset of objects would I focus my actions on?
                </li>
                </ul>

                Sometimes it might be hard to choose which annotations to use, or you may not be familiar with the environment in the photo, but just make your best guess.
                < br/>

          <b>Here is an Example:</b>
        </Typography>
        <br/>
        <br/>

        <div className={classes.gifContainer}>

          <h3>General Guidelines</h3>
          Here are some things to keep in mind: 

          <ul>
          <li>There may be some overlap in the two annotations, that is ok.
          </li>
          <li>
          When adding the annotations, make sure to consider any element that could be relevant to the activity you would perform in the space, including buttons or knobs, not just objects.
          </li>
          <li>
          There is no time limit per image.
          </li>
          <li>
          If there are watermarks on the image, please ignore them while making your annotation.
          </li>
          </ul>
        </Typography>
        <br/>
        <div className={classes.gifContainer}>
          <img src={ImgGuidelines1} width="80%" style={{marginRight: 16}} />

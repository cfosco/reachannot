          Interacting in Reachable Spaces

          <h3>Instructions</h3>
                In this experiment, you will be asked to annotate the interactable objects in pictures of reachable environments. Specifically, you will use a paintbrush tool to indicate <strong> any object, button, switch, or item that you can use or manipulate when performing an action.</strong>
                < br/>< br/>

                There are two different annotations to use:                 
                <ul>
                <li> Use the first color to indicate the subset of objects you are MOST LIKELY to interact with. This could be one object or many, but it should be the subset of objects that you would probably be using if you were experiencing the view in the picture.
                </li>
                <li> Use the second color to indicate ALL of the remaining objects or components that it is possible to interact with.
                </li>
                </ul>

                After using both annotations, you should have painted over every object or component that a person could interact with. Sometimes it might be hard to choose which annotations to use, or you may not be familiar with the environment in the photo, but just make your best guess.
                < br/>

          <h3>General Guidelines</h3>
          Here are some things to keep in mind: 

          <ul>
          <li>Try to reduce the overlap in the two annotations.
          </li>
          <li>
          When adding the annotations, make sure to consider any element that could be relevant to the activity you would perform in the space, including buttons or knobs, not just objects.
          </li>
          <li>
          There is no time limit per image.
          </li>
          <li>
          If there are watermarks on the image, please ignore them while making your annotation.
          </li>
          </ul>
        </Typography>
        <br/>
        <div className={classes.gifContainer}>
          <img src={ImgGuidelines1} width="80%" style={{marginRight: 16}} />
